# Summary of what I did
This project uses GraphQL and MongoDB for to create a persistant backend and utilizes React with Emotion and MaterialUi on the front end.

I created reusable components to create a navbar, a transaction table, a break down of amount spent using a pie chart, and the ability to add, edit, and remove transactions on and off the table.

While working on this project I learned to use EmotionJS and used it from one central file to distribut styles accross all components. I also used Grid Template Areas for the first time and that was fun! I had never used MongoDB as well so that certainly was a wild ride getting the database to work the first time. I have never used Recharts before which is what I used on the pie chart and I have to say it was extremely simple and fast to pick up and add in.

The challenges also brought learning opportunities with Unit tests which really ramped in complexity when mocking Apollo calls. Also getting the repo to run provided many challenges.

All in all, I had a good time creating this and hope the love and effort shows. 



# Divvy Homework Assignment

This repository provides a starting point for a basic React + GraphQL application.
All of the configuration boilerplate is complete so you can start by writing the code that you want us to see.

Please **fork** this repo a **private repo** on your GitHub account.

Please share your finished project repo with @thawk55 and @jakerichan as part of your submission.

<br />


## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/webapp`) and two server directories (eg `/webserver` and `/elixir`).

The `/webserver` one includes a functional GraphQL server in NodeJS with MongoDB backing it.

The `/elixir` one includes a functional GraphQL server in Elixir with Postgresql backing it.

If you are applying for backend, you should use the elixir code.
If you are applying for frontend, feel free to use either.

This project is _intentionally not utilizing 3rd party services or create-react-app_ to give you the opportunity to showcase your talents wherever they are, be it the front end or the back end.

## Instructions

If you are pursuing a full stack or backend position, please include elixir code changes in your homework.

See the [Frontend instructions](webapp/README.md) for frontend focused instructions.  If front end only, use the node server in `/webserver`.

See the [Backend instructions](backend.md) for backend focused instructions.
